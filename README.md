# DAT505 Advanced Coding



## Getting Started

This is a README file to show how to operate this project on your own personal computer. Below will be the instructions listed in a sequence order.

My project is about allowing the user to see the different state of beings there are i
our daily lives and what one they think they are currently in. Each option that is listed is based on emotion and state of consciousness.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development running

Please run the dat.gui in the command line to install the library files to link to the html.

```
$ npm install --save dat.gui
```

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```


## Running the tests


To run the project just simply run the 'atom-live-server' and a window should open in your default browser.

The project should play sound so please do and turn your volume up to play the background music

### And coding style tests

Each script tag operates the project independently and uses them to operate the project. Without these tags it will not run properly so please do and make sure that you have the correct folders. If not then you can download them from the 'three.js' website https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/

## Development of project

First I had to create a character in maya so that I had an object to work with. I had done this by importing an already template of a human body and then started to implement different shapes around it. To run the project just simply run the 'atom-live-server' and a window should open in your default browser.

<img width="500" alt="character" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33899472/50973639-505d4e00-14e1-11e9-8625-f7e0b97a02fa.png">

Then I started to add new materials to the model by saving images from the internet and then stated to UV edit the model to make it flat, so then I was able to use the image to cut out the parts I needed.

On the coding aspect of it, I imported the object and material that I had created with 'maya' and gave it a desired position and rotation.  I had then used the MeshPhongMaterial function to set up an outer sphere around the character.

For the next step I had added more 'MeshPhongMaterials' to the object and set them a colour according to the option the user has decided to select.

This is the options I have got for the frequency chart. As said above each option is an emotion or a state of consciousness. So you get to control what option you think you're currently are and the character will change colour.
